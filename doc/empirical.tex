\section{Empirical Results}\label{sec:experiment}

In this section we present the empirical results obtained from running Hash-join, LIP and LIP-$k$ on several datasets. In Section \ref{sec:dataset}, we present the dataset we used and how we manually apply skewness to generate skewed and adversarial datasets; in Section \ref{sec:time} we present the running time of multiple strategies and discuss their performance; and in Section \ref{sec:ratio} we discuss how $k$ affects the competitive ratio of LIP-$k$ empirically on our dataset.



\subsection{Skewed and Adversarial Datasets}
\label{sec:dataset}
The dataset for testing is obtained from the Star Schema Benchmark \cite{o2009star}. We will hard-code each queries in \cite{o2009star} to measure the join processing time.
